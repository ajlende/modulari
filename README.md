# Modulari

Modulari (Latin) - to modulate, to beat time, to measure, to regulate (as in music :wink::musical_note:)

Simple client for [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com) built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [Cycle](http://cycle.js.org).

This project is in its infancy, so many things will be broken or not exist at the moment.

The currently active branch is `feature/header-component`

## Usage
```sh
$ npm install -g electron-prebuilt
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
