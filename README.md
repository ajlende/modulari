# Modulari

Simple client for [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com) built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) and [Cycle](http://cycle.js.org).

This project is in its infancy, so many things will be broken or not exist at the moment.

Boilerplate was taken from [edge/electron-cycle-media](https://github.com/edge/electron-cycle-media).

## Usage
```sh
$ npm i -g electron-prebuilt
$ npm i
$ electron .
```
